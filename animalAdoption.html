    <h1> Pet Adoption</h1>
    <p>There are many animals who need homes and have been carelessly created and tossed aside like garbage. These poor
        souls deserve love and respect like any living creature.
        It is our duty as humans to help restore the delicate balance that is upset by our own humanity's disreguard for
        life. Please we ask you lend a saving hand
        to these beautiful creatures! Follow the links bellow to adopt a worthy pet!</p>
